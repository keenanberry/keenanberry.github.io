<h2>RESEARCH EXPERIENCE</h2>
<br>
<h4>Meyers (“Small RNA”) Laboratory | Apr 2018 – present</h4><br>
Donald Danforth Plant Science Center<br>
&emsp;&bull; Analyzed sequence variation data from the 1001 Genomes Project to identify and visualize intraspecific microRNA variation in 1135 accessions of Arabidopsis thaliana; research investigations found that the presence of SNPs affects the stability of miRNA secondary structures and potentially inhibits the regulatory functions of miRNAs. <br>
&emsp;&bull; Initiated transposable element (TE) detection and analysis in 84 lines of Spirodela polyrhiza. <br>
&emsp;&bull; Plan to utilize bioinformatics pipeline created for miRNA variation analysis in A. thaliana for a similar analysis on data obtained from the 3000 Rice Genomes (3kRG) Project. <br>

<h4>Proulx (“Theoretical Evolution”) Laboratory | Sep 2017 – Apr 2018</h4> <br>
EEMB Department, University of California at Santa Barbara <br>
&emsp;&bull; Focused on developing theoretical models to understand fitness and selection processes involved in evolution.<br>
&emsp;&bull; Assisted with microbiology procedures involved in the experimental evolution studies of the yeast species Saccharomyces cerevisiae.<br>

Marine Genomics Laboratory | Jan 2016 – Aug 2016 <br>
Department of Marine Biology and Ecology, University of Miami <br>
&emsp;&bull; Collaborated with Atlantic Oceanographic & Meteorological Laboratory of NOAA to investigate the roll of salinity fluctuations in causing selection by analyzing the genetic variation and connectivity among populations of rainwater killifish (Lucania parva) in Florida’s Biscayne Bay; evidence from investigations has the potential to justify the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan, a government initiative spending $10.5 billion over 35 years to restore the Everglades’ natural drainage system. <br>
&emsp;&bull; Investigated connectivity of over-fished populations of parrotfish species in the Bahama islands by determining the potential identity of larval DNA in the parrotfish genus Sparisoma through sequence alignment comparisons and phylogenetic analyses; research findings have the potential to enhance fishing regulations and management strategies in the Bahama islands. <br>

Comparative Sedimentology Laboratory | Sep 2015 – Jul 2016 <br>
Department of Geological Sciences, University of Miami <br>
&emsp;&bull; Characterized the reef communities found in present-day Dominican Republic and used GIS software to create virtual models to understand the changes that were occurring on Caribbean reef systems during the Plio-Pleistocene faunal turnover event. <br>
&emsp;&bull; Investigated the diversity and classification of Plio-Pleistocene coral reef communities to assist senior lab members in defining the evolutionary and ecological transition of Caribbean reef assemblages and in better understanding the causes of faunal turnover in consideration of regional climatic and oceanographic events. <br>

RELEVANT PROJECTS
<br>
Analysis of microRNA Variation in Arabidopsis thaliana		Summer 2018
Meyers Lab, Donald Danforth Plant Science Center
•	Utilized gene sequence variation data from the 1001 Genomes Project and miRNA data from miRBase to identify and visualize intraspecific miRNA variation in 1135 accessions of Arabidopsis thaliana. 
•	Visualized single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) along miRNA sequences with a mutation distribution graphics tool in trackViewer, a Bioconductor/R package.
•	Generated alternate fasta sequences from the reference miRNA fasta and sequence variation data to analyze the secondary structures of the miRNA molecules and to investigate the alignment of miRNA molecules to their target genes.  
•	Used the ViennaRNA package to calculate the minimum free energy (MFE) of pre-miRNA secondary structures; the results indicated that the accumulation of SNPs increases the MFE value, lowering the stability of the molecule.  
•	Used gene sequence variation data to show that at least one target gene sequence lacks a complementary SNP at the miRNA cleavage recognition site, potentially inhibiting repression of target gene (functional genomics study is needed to confirm this). 

Mining HIV-1/Human Protein Interaction Networks for –Quasi-Bicliques Reveals Potential Viral Infection Pathways						Fall 2017
CMPSC 292F, UCSB
•	Implemented an agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm on a bipartite network of HIV-1 and human proteins; the network was mined for -quasi-bicliques, which isolated the human proteins most likely to interact with specific HIV-1 proteins during viral infection.
•	Utilized the same agglomerative clustering and -quasi-clique and biclique mining on two additional networks: a human protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and an undirected bipartite network of human proteins and disease states.
•	Targeted gateway proteins and potential infection pathways in the human PPI network via HIV-human interaction clusters indicative of strong protein complexes.
•	Performed bipartite network analysis to identify links between these novel proteins and various disease states.
•	The project provided valuable information about cellular mechanisms involved in the HIV infection process and generated information potentially useful in pharmaceutical development.
